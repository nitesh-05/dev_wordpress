<p><strong>CSS</strong> is short for <em><a href=\"https://journocode.com/dictionary/cascading-style-sheets/\">Cascading Style Sheets</a></em>. This is the code that tells your browser how your webpage should <em>look</em>: What fonts and colors to use, what size your text should be etc.. But a pretty-looking website is not all you could want. You might want to interact with the webpage, click things, move stuff around and have it respond to your actions. HTML and CSS can’t do that very well, but <em>JavaScript</em> can.</p>
