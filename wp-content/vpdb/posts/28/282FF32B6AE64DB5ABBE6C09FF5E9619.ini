<p><strong>HTML</strong>, or <em><a href=\"https://localhost:3000\" data-type=\"URL\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">HyperText Markup Language</a></em>, is the backbone of any webpage. It determines its basic <em>structure and content</em>. However, if you only use HTML, your webpage will end up looking like the very first pages from the early days of the web. No pretty formatting, no interactive elements. You’ll see it sometimes when your internet connection is very slow and your browser won’t load the page properly. It’s okay, but we can to better. That’s what <em>CSS</em> is for.</p>

<p>Any HTML document starts with the declaration&nbsp;&lt;!DOCTYPE&nbsp;html&gt;&nbsp;that tells the browser what kind of document to expect (html in this case, duh). Then, there’s the&nbsp;&lt;html&gt;&nbsp; tag. It doesn’t close until the very end of the page and makes it extra clear that anything in between will, in fact, be HTML code.</p>
